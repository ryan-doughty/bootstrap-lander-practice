***Git flow process***
I've created the following branches:

master
staging
release/0.1.0
feature-1 (Changes button color)
feature-2 ( Changes Title Text and Size )
feature-3-crazy-town (Removes a row and adds the Hero Banner markup and styles )

Staging:
-feature-1, feature-2, and feature-3-crazy-town are merged into staging for development and testing.

Next step:
-feature-1 and feature-2 approved for release/0.1.0
-merge these branches into release/0.1.0
